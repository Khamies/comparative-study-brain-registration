# BMIR: Benchmarking Multi-modal Image Registration
This project benchmarks traditional and deep learning-based methods for multi-modal medical image registration. Using MRI and CT data, it evaluates accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across techniques like MI, NCC, VoxelMorph, DeepReg, and LapIRN to identify strengths, limitations, and clinical potential.
